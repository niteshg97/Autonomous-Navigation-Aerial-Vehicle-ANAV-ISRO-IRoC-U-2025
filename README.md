# ANAV â€” Autonomous Navigation Aerial Vehicle  
**IRoC-U 2025 | Robotics Club NIT Patna | Team ID: 11318**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **Autonomous Navigation Aerial Vehicle (ANAV)** is a custom-built UAV platform developed for **autonomous landing and safe navigation in uncertain environments**.  
Designed for the **Indian Rover Challenge â€“ Unmanned (IRoC-U) 2025**, this system integrates **onboard perception**, **sensor fusion**, and **robust control algorithms** to perform stable hover, trajectory tracking, and safe landing without manual intervention.

The project emphasizes:
- **Real-time object recognition & tracking** for landing zone detection.
- **Sensor fusion using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** for accurate pose estimation.
- **Adaptive PID control** for smooth and stable flight.
- **Failsafe and emergency landing protocols** for operational safety.
